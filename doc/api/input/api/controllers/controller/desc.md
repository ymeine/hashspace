Controllers are aimed to be used together with templates.

A controller is a class, which means a set of methods and attributes, and the concept of instances

Features:

* attributes
	* typing
	* binding: 1 way = out (template) -> in (controller), 2 way = the other way too
	* default values
	* `on[Attribute]Change`
* `init`
* `dispose`
