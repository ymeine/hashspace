<p>
	You can define input elements as you would do in pure HTML.
</p>
<p>
	As for other elements inside a template, inputs support expressions for all their attributes, and thus binding.
</p>
<p>
	The interesting thing is that if such an expression is used to define the <code>value</code> attribute of the input, this value will be synchronized with the data model (classical binding).
</p>
<p>
	This synchronization is done one the <code>keyup</code> event.
</p>
<p>
	The attribute <code>model</code> can be used instead of <code>value</code>. This has been introduced to enhance the capability of some specific inputs (for details, see sections below).
