	Radio buttons are special since they behave as a group of values where only one is selected at a time.
</p>
<p>
	Indeed, a radio button alone holds both a selected state and a value.
</p>
<p>
	A group of radio buttons on its hand will have a single value, corresponding to its currently selected one. But they all aim at setting the <strong>same property of the same model</strong>.
</p>
<p>
	That's why we introduced an additional attribute, called <code>model</code>, which will contain the expression referencing the property of the model to bind. This property will receive the value specified in the attribute <code>value</code> of the currently selected radio button.
</p>
<p>
	Since a group of radio buttons is naturally identified by the fact that they all reference the same property of the model, groups will automatically be built regarding the value of the <code>model</code> attribute.
