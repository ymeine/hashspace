<p>
The following standard methods of Array's prototype have been overridden for this purpose: <code>splice</code>, <code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>, <code>shift</code>, <code>unshift</code>, <code>reverse</code>, <code>sort</code>.
</p>
<p>
In addition to those methods, one more has been added: <code>splice2</code>, see corresponding section for more information.
</p>
<p>
This means that listeners added on the array will be notified about the changes.
