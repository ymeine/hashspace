We'll consider two parts in this kind of expression: the left expression, before the colon, and the right expression which lays after.

Those parts can be any simple expressions, which means not compound nor conditional ones.

The right expression determines whether the result of the left expression should be displayed or not: yes if the right part is truthy, no otherwise.
