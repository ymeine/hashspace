You can combine several expressions into one expression statement using the comma; note that there is only one pair of braces which is for the compound expression, subexpressions being delimited by commas.

The results of the expressions will be concatenated with a single white space before it is output.

Because of the space which always gets _inserted between the expressions_, it does not suit all use cases. However, this is perfect to define the `class` attribute of a HTML element for instance.
