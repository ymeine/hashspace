A controller is defined using the `klass` utility. Please refer to its documentation to know how it works.

To quickly summarize how it works, classes are defined by giving a `$constructor` method and the rest is taken as part of the prototype of the class.

What matters here are the specific methods and properties used by components, which make the class actually be a controller.

There are two main fields discussed is dedicated sections below:

* attributes
* life cycle methods
