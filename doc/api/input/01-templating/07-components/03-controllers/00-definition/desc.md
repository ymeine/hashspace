A controller is defined using the `klass` utility. Please refer to its documentation to know how it works.

To quickly summarize it, classes are defined by giving a `$constructor` method and the rest is taken as part of the prototype of the class. By the way, note that for controllers, the `$constructor` method should not be defined.

What matters here are the specific methods and properties used by components, which make the class actually be a controller.

There are two main fields discussed in dedicated sections below:

* attributes
* life cycle methods
