Attributes with type `template` expect to receive a template source as a value, therefore a string (__a reference to a template instance won't work__). The latter will be automatically compiled, and then one will be able to use the attribute to reference the generated template - as any other reference to a template.

Like any other attribute, its value can be passed using the standard ways (subtemplate attribute or `render` API). It can also be passed using the block form of component instantiation (with block content or sub-attribute elements), please refer to the corresponding section on how to use it.
