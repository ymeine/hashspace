HTML elements in templates are almost like standard elements, but they have a special syntax allowing the use of __expressions and statements__.

Expressions can be found anywhere in text content of block elements. Expressions can also be found in values of tags' attributes. However, there are different kind of expressions and there can be restrictions in some cases (required to use a specific kind or forbidden to use some).

Statements on the other hand can only be found inside the content of block elements (and not the tag). There are _block_ and _inline_ statements, and they follow the same strict rules of nesting as XHTML elements, which means for instance that you can't surround an opening tag with a block statement.

For more information on expressions and statements, please refer to their corresponding sections.
