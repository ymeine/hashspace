HTML elements in templates are almost like standard elements, but they have a special syntax allowing the use of expressions and statements.

Expressions can be found anywhere in text content of block elements. Expressions can also be found in values of tag attributes. However, there are different kind of expressions and there can be restrictions in some cases (required to use a specific type or forbidden to use some).

Statements on the other hand can only be found inside the content of block elements (and not the tag). There are block and inline statements, and they follow the same strict rules of nesting as XHTML elements, which means you can't surround an opening tag with a block statement for instance.

For more information on expressions and statements, please refer to their corresponding documentations.
