<p>
	A template has the following properties:

	<ul>
		<li><strong>a name</strong>: the name of the reference to the template; works as any variable</li>
		<li><strong>formal parameters</strong>: a list of names for formal parameters. From the template, the names are used as references to the actual parameters. From the outside, actual parameters can be given <strong>by both position and name</strong>, depending on how the template is instantiated! Keep this in mind when defining your template.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>For reminder, a template is finally compiled by the engine and converted to a function, which returns a template instance bound to the given parameters when it gets called.</p>
